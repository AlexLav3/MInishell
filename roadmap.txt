⚠️ = important issue (serious problem). even if fixed, check if happens on other edge cases/occasions.


-----------USEFUL INFO-----------

P.S. I ADDED THE WERROR WEXTRA IN THE MAKEFILE 
just to check and clean up, feel free to take it off if you need.
--reply--
f: I think it is mandatory to have them anyway, so it is good you added them.


ps -eAo state,pid,comm | grep -w Z 
this command checks for zombie processes, child processes that hasn't been terminated once the parent is close_pipes_and_wait
atm we have none, but may be a nice check with multiple childs. 
--reply--
f:	how do you check it with multiple childs?
	I think our child processes are handled well, so it should be okay. 

-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------


-----------TO DO LIST-----------

please check valgrind, the laptop I'm using (not mine) doesn't have it
especially with quotes and var expantions.
--reply--
f: 	yeah, checked. we have issue/leak in simple world function, but it has the same code in handle_q
	so I think we will have issue there as well
		word = process_word(ft_substr(str, start, i - start), shell, EXPAND);
		we allocate str in ft_substring and we need to free it. 
		Previously you called (*tks)->chunk = ft_substr(str, start, i - start);
		Can we do it againa and add that variable into the process_word function?
		And free it after we used it. 

--------------------18-05-26 notes ------------------------

HEREDOC:
heredoc examples to check:
	if we need ot hadnle variables:
		name="Alice"
		cat << EOF
		Hi $name,
		Welcome to the shell!
		EOF
	result:
		Hi Alice,
		Welcome to the shell!

	redirecting to a file:
		cat << EOF > myfile.txt
		This will go into a file.
		Not just to the terminal.
		EOF
	
	using pipe:
		cat << EOF | grep "hello"
		hello bar
		ooo world
		here is is hello again
		EOF

	other command apart cat before heredoc:
		grep "bash" << EOF | sort
		zsh is nice
		bash is better
		fish is cool
		bash rocks
		EOF
