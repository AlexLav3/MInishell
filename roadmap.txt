-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------

fixed as far as we can currently tell:
- Not save command if it started with a single space.
	impletemented fix: 
	updated the init.c due to history. 

- pipe issue due to tokenazation/array
		prompt> ls -a | wc -l
		21
		prompt> ls -a |wc -l
		ls: cannot access '|wc': No such file or directory

		impletemented fix: 
		new split token functions were added and implemented, tested as well with pipes. 

edge cases:

 echo - edges example which I am not sure we need to handle. This maybe something extra and we can skip. (fingers crossed)
	a command like : echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
	[echo ] -> [stuff] -> ["abcdef"] -> [""] (special tokens will have "" nodes instead of spaces) -> [$SHLVL] -> ['pizza']
		-bash behaviour: stuffabcdef 2pizza
	
other issues: 
- memory leaks 

-----------TO DO LIST-----------

to start :
- Ignore \ and ; in the command line (or prevent something)
- redirections: <, >, <<, >>
- $? 
- understand + handle dollar sign.

in progress:
- single and double quotes
