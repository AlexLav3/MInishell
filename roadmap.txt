⚠️ = important issue (serious problem). even if fixes, check if happens on other edge cases/occasions.

-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------

fixed as far as we can currently tell:
- Not save command if it started with a single space.
	impletemented fix: 
	updated the init.c due to history. 
	?please clarify - bash: command " ls" appears in history.

	-cd - fixed spaces in the command line. 
	examples: cd ../ Documents -> invalid 
			  cd .. /Documents -> invalid  
			  (as in bash)

- pipe issue due to tokenazation/array
		prompt> ls -a | wc -l
		21
		prompt> ls -a |wc -l
		ls: cannot access '|wc': No such file or directory

		impletemented fix: 
		new split token functions were added and implemented, tested as well with pipes. 

edge cases:

 echo - edges example which I am not sure we need to handle. This maybe something extra and we can skip. (fingers crossed)
	a command like : echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
	[echo ] -> [stuff] -> ["abcdef"] -> [""] (special tokens will have "" nodes instead of spaces) -> [$SHLVL] -> ['pizza']
		-bash behaviour: stuffabcdef 2pizza
		-minishell behaviour: stuff abcdef $ SHLVL'pizza'

		⚠️ minishell: 
		prompt> echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
		stuff abcdef $ SHLVL'pizza'
		free(): invalid pointer
		zsh: IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./minishell - fized the core dump for the moment, however, there is still an issue.	 
		NOTE: 
		with gdb, it seems the make args gets after we already freed something/args get lost
		(we have them basically frees everywhere lol) ⚠️

other issues:
- memory leaks

-----------TO DO LIST-----------

to start :
- Ignore \ and ; in the command line (or prevent something)
- redirections: <, >, <<, >>
- $? 
- understand + handle dollar sign.

in progress:
- single and double quotes

-----TO DISCUSS-----
 
- split tokens functions and need (disccus if we can find other maybe working, possibly more efficient implementations.)
