⚠️ = important issue (serious problem). even if fixed, check if happens on other edge cases/occasions.


-----------USEFUL INFO-----------

P.S. I ADDED THE WERROR WEXTRA IN THE MAKEFILE 
just to check and clean up, feel free to take it off if you need.

f: I think it is mandatory to have them anyway, so it is good you added them.
yes, it is just annoying to have them at the beginning. 

ps -eAo state,pid,comm | grep -w Z 
this command checks for zombie processes, child processes that hasn't been terminated once the parent is close_pipes_and_wait
atm we have none, but may be a nice check with multiple childs. 
--reply--
f:	how do you check it with multiple childs? - check every time, shows if any is still going.
	I think our child processes are handled well, so it should be okay. 

-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------


-----------TO DO LIST-----------

echo hello<>?:"polka"
hello <> ?:polka  --fixed

wrong:
echo $D
$D - ok, I'll fix.

prompt> > file echo message
redir: : Permission denied
message

//bash: (random example)
 % ./input.c 
zsh: permission denied: ./input.c

prompt: echo -n aa
aa
prompt: 
// supposed to be: 
prompt: echo -n aa
aapromtpt:

//bash: 
elavrich@c3r8s1 ~/Documents/homegit/mian
 % echo -n aa
aa%                                                                                           
elavrich@c3r8s1 ~/Documents/homegit/mian
 % 
sure it does not print a new line, but the new prompt is not on the same line.
