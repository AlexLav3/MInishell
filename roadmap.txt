⚠️ = important issue (serious problem). even if fixed, check if happens on other edge cases/occasions.

-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------

edge cases:

	echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
		-bash behaviour: stuffabcdef 2pizza
		-minishell behaviour: stuff abcdef 2 pizza
to fix:
all tokenitation and cmd creation.


other issues:
- minishell should be executable inside the minishell itself.

-----------TO DO LIST-----------
re-think different implementation for words, expansion, quotes, and cmd creation.
an older version worked, but created extra spaces where there shoudn't be any.
possible need for macros and flags +  extra step before smd creation.

example of commands to check for (but not all) and expected behaviour: 

echo "$USER"'$USER'
egervais$USER

echo "$USER""'$USER'"
egervais'egervais'

echo '$USER'$USER
$USERegervais
