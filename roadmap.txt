basic commands and ctr stuff, history working, and no leaks so far, good job to us! XD

//
actual to-do -main
    handle quotes -> double ok, handle single.

    built in commands:
    missing: cd, export, unset
    ok so far: ls, echo, pwd, env, exit, (echo -n doesn't do anything as I see in normal bash, maybe edge cases?)

    piping
    redirection
    $
    $?
//
fixing 
    not typing anything and pressing enter = "command not found" - maybe fixed

    prompt> ls (space after ls) - fixed, now works no matter how many spaces you put after ls, with or without a flag.
