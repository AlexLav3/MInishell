⚠️ = important issue (serious problem). even if fixes, check if happens on other edge cases/occasions.

-------------ISSUES AND FIXES-----------------

edge cases:

 echo - edges example which I am not sure we need to handle. This maybe something extra and we can skip. (fingers crossed)
	a command like : echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
	[echo ] -> [stuff] -> ["abcdef"] -> [""] (special tokens will have "" nodes instead of spaces) -> [$SHLVL] -> ['pizza']
		-bash behaviour: stuffabcdef 2pizza
		-minishell behaviour: stuff abcdef $ SHLVL'pizza'

		minishell: 
		prompt> echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza' 
		halways works, half not, I will check what's wrong.

% cat test.txt | grep "42 | sort | wc -l 
elavrich@c3r8s1 ~/Documents/homegit/mini
pipe dquote> "

other issues:
- memory leaks
- minishell should be executable inside the minishell itself 

-----------TO DO LIST-----------

to start :
- redirections: <, >, <<, >>
- $? 
- understand + handle dollar sign.

in progress:
- single and double quotes

-----TO DISCUSS-----


--dollar sign example
 % export NAME=alex
elavrich@c3r7s4 ~/Documents/homegit/met_ext
 % echo $NAME
alex
