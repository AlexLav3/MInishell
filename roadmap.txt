basic commands and ctr stuff, working, and no leaks so far, good job to us! XD

//
actual to-do -main
    handle quotes -> handle in tokenization process?
    built in commands, some of them not behaving as should.
    
    piping
    redirection
    $?
    env -> that should be easy.
//
fixing 
    not typing anything and pressing enter = "command not found" - maybe fixed

    prompt> ls (space after ls) - fixed
